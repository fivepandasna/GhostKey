Click G on your keyboard to create a ghost block where you are looking.

I'm sure you know the purpose of ghost blocks.



## Change key
To change the key you have to click to create a ghost block, here's what you have to do

Type /setghostkey "key". Replace "key" with whatever alphabetic key you want, such as "H".

If a key doesn't work, it is likely because it is bound to another action. If not, message me on my provided discord.
